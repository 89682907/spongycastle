Spongy Castle is a repackage of **Bouncy Castle**, targeted at Android, with no substantial differences to the code (just renaming of packages, etc). The GitHub repository for Bouncy Castle can be found at https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java .

This means that if you think you have a bug in Spongy Castle that's not specific to Android, you first need to check whether the problem can be reproduced in the Bouncy Castle code base. If the problem originates in Bouncy Castle, you'll need to raise an issue with the Bouncy Castle project to get it fixed - once that fix is released, I can make a fresh release of Spongycastle based on that updated version.
